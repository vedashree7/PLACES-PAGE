One of the most stunning palaces in India, it derives its beauty from its grand structure, tile floorings and lovely wooden ceilings. Today, it has been converted into a State Museum which showcases the art and culture of the Northeast. Ujjayanta Palace was built between 1899 and 1901, and covers an area of 250 acres.</p>
