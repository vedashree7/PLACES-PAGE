 <p style=font-size:120%;>Tipu Sultan’s Summer Palace is an example of Indo-Islamic architecture and served as the summer residence of Tipu Sultan. The teak wood, large fluted pillars that helps support the structure, and the walls and ceilings decorated with floral patterns, are all examples of stunning art. The fort houses a museum that displays a portrait of the monarch and a wide collection of his clothes, a couple of swords and the missiles that were used during the wars with the British.</p>
