 <p style=font-size:120%;>If you are travelling to Rajasthanâ€™s romantic city, you must visit the stunning Monsoon Palace, perched on a hill in Udaipur. It overlooks the Fateh Sagar Lake and the city. Built in 1884, the Monsoon Palace, as the name suggests, was originally meant to be a 9 storied astronomical observatory which would record the arrival of monsoons by keeping track of the monsoon clouds.</p>
