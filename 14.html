 <p style=font-size:120%;>City Place counted among the best royal palaces in Jaipur, thanks to its massive complex featuring courtyards, gardens and small palaces. Located in the middle of the Old City of Jaipur in North India, the City Palace dates back to the early 20th century. Originally built by Jai Singh II, it displays an amazing combination of Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles. Some of the top attractions to check out are Diwan-i-Am Art Gallery, Mubarak Mahal, Pitam Niwas Chowk and others.</p>
