 </center>
 <p style=font-size:120%;>Amba Vilas Palace was the seat of the Wodeyar Dynasty, whose structure reflects Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic styles. Popularly known as Mysore Maharaja Palace, it is as stunning and gorgeous on the outside, as it is on the inside. One of the most fascinating things about the palace is that it has impressive illumination. Every evening, the entire complex glows with golden light presenting a regal ambience.</p>
